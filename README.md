## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher recommended)
- **npm** (v9 or higher) or **yarn**

You can check your versions by running:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## 🏃 Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd My_Portfolio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   - The development server will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown in terminal)
   - The page will automatically reload when you make changes

## 🏗️ Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will:
- Create an optimized production build in the `dist/` directory
- Minify JavaScript and CSS
- Optimize assets for production

### Preview Production Build

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## 🚢 Deployment

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. Deploy:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to link your project

### Option 2: Netlify

1. Install Netlify CLI:
   ```bash
   npm i -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. Build and deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
   ```

### Option 3: GitHub Pages

1. Install `gh-pages`:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```

2. Add to `package.json`:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
   }
   ```

3. Deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Option 4: Traditional Web Hosting

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Upload the contents of the `dist/` folder to your web server

3. Configure your server to serve `index.html` for all routes (for React Router compatibility)
